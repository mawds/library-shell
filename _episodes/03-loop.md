**Loops** are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute
commands repetitively. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing (and typing mistakes).
Suppose we have several hundred Etext files named `33504-0.txt`, `829-0.txt`, and so on.
In this example,
we'll use the data we used in previous lessons which only has two example files,
but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.
We would like to modify these files, but also save a version of the original files, naming the copies
`original-33504-0.txt`, `original-829-0.txt`
We can't use:

~~~
$ cp *.txt original-*.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

because that would expand to:

~~~
$ cp 33504-0.txt 829-0.txt original-*.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

This wouldn't back up our files, instead we get an error:

~~~
cp: target `original-*.txt' is not a directory
~~~
{: .error}

This problem arises when `cp` receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it
expects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.
Since there is no directory named `original-*.txt` in the `creatures` directory we get an
error.

Instead, we can use a **loop**
to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
Here's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:

~~~
$ for filename in 33504-0.txt 829-0.txt
> do
>    head -n 3 $filename
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

{: .output}

When the shell sees the keyword `for`,
it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing `in` a list.
For each iteration,
the name of the each thing is sequentially assigned to
the **variable** and the commands inside the loop are executed before moving on to 
the next thing in the list.
Inside the loop,
we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.
The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat
the **variable** as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command. 

In this example, the list is two filenames: `33504-0.txt` and `829-0.txt`.
Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`
and run the `head` command.
The first time through the loop,
`$filename` is `33504-0.txt`. 
The interpreter runs the command `head` on `33504-0.txt`, 
and the prints the 
first three lines of `basilisk.dat`.
For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes 
`829-0.txt`. This time, the shell runs `head` on `829-0.txt`
and prints the first three lines of `unicorn.dat`.
Since the list was only two items, the shell exits the `for` loop.

When using variables it is also
possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable
name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from
`${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people's programs.

{: .callout}

We have called the variable in this loop `filename`
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:

~~~
for x in 33504-0.txt 829-0.txt
do
    head -n 3 $x
done
~~~
{: .bash}

or:

~~~
for temperature in 33504-0.txt 829-0.txt
do
    head -n 3 $temperature
done
~~~
{: .bash}

it would work exactly the same way.
*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`)
increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.

Here's a slightly more complicated loop:

~~~
for filename in *.txt
do
    echo $filename
    head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
done
~~~
{: .bash}

The shell starts by expanding `*.txt` to create the list of files it will process.
The **loop body**
then executes two commands for each of those files.
The first, `echo`, just prints its command-line parameters to standard output.
For example:

~~~
$ echo hello there
~~~
{: .bash}

prints:

~~~
hello there
~~~
{: .output}

In this case,
since the shell expands `$filename` to be the name of a file,
`echo $filename` just prints the name of the file.
Note that we can't write this as:

~~~
for filename in *.txt
do
    $filename
    head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
done
~~~
{: .bash}

because then the first time through the loop,
when `$filename` expanded to `33504-0.txt`, the shell would try to run `33504-0.txt` as a program.
Finally,
the `head` and `tail` combination selects lines 81-100
from whatever file is being processed
(assuming the file has at least 100 lines).

{: .callout}

Going back to our original file copying problem,
we can solve it using this loop:

~~~
for filename in *.txt
do
    cp $filename original-$filename
done
~~~
{: .bash}

This loop runs the `cp` command once for each filename.
The first time,
when `$filename` expands to `33504-0.txt`,
the shell executes:

~~~
cp 33504-0.txt original-33504-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

The second time, the command is:

~~~
cp 829-0.txt original-829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Since the `cp` command does not normally produce any output, it's hard to check 
that the loop is doing the correct thing. By prefixing the command with `echo` 
it is possible to see each command as it _would_ be executed:

~~~
for filename in *.txt
do
    echo $filename
    cp $filename original-$filename
done
~~~
{: .bash}

## Processing many files

The `shell-lesson.zip` file which you downloded earlier contains a directory called `paine`.  This contains some of the works of Thomas Paine, in plain text format.  These are part of the [ECCO-TCP](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-ecco/), and were downloaded from <https://github.com/Anterotesis/historical-texts>.   The directory also contains a program (strictly a shell script, which we will cover in the next lesson) that will count the number of occurences 
of a word within a file (ignoring case).  The filenames, and the number of times the word occured will be printed. For example, if we had a text file containing: "The cat sat on the mat", and ran:

~~~
$ bash countword cat.txt "the"
> 2 cat.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

In this part of the lesson we will use the countword program and some loops to look at how often certain words occur in the texts.  We will use a _script_ to make it easier to re-run and adapt this analysis. A script is a collection of commands, stored in a text file.  The `countword` program used above is actually a script.

Let's use the `countword` program to count the number of times "America" occurs in each text.  We can do this using a loop.  As we're learning to use the shell, we will build up the required commands in stages.

Our first step is to select the right files:

~~~
$ cd paine
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}

We see that all the files start 'K' and end '.txt'. We only want to process these files.

~~~
$ for datafile in K*.txt
> do
>     echo $datafile
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
K000934.000.txt
K006500.000.txt
K011684.000.txt
...
K133948.000.txt
K134413.000.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Our next step is to call the countword program with the appropriate parameters for each file.  It's good practice to check that the script is going to run the commands you think it is by `echo`ing the commands to the screen first:


~~~
$ for datafile in K*.txt
> do echo bash ./countword $datafile "america"
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
bash ./countword K000934.000.txt america
bash ./countword K006500.000.txt america
bash ./countword K011684.000.txt america
...
bash ./countword K133430.000.txt america
bash ./countword K133948.000.txt america
bash ./countword K134413.000.txt america
~~~
{: .output}

We haven't actually run `countword` yet, but we can see the commands are correct.  Before we run the loop, let's take a brief diversion to look at how to save time and reduce the potential for errors.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
though.  In this section we look at some shortcuts that can save a lot of time, and reduce the potential for errors.

If we press the up arrow, 
the shell redisplays the whole loop on one line
(using semi-colons to separate the pieces):

~~~
$ for datafile in K*.txt; do echo bash ./countword $datafile "america"; done
~~~
{: .bash}

Using the left arrow key, we can delete the `echo` command:

~~~
$ for datafile in K*.txt; do bash ./countword $datafile "america"; done
~~~
{: .bash}

{: .callout}


> ## Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It
>
> Another way to repeat previous work is to use the `history` command to
> get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and
> then to use `!123` (where "123" is replaced by the command number) to

>
> ~~~
> $ history | tail -n 5
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
 2105  ls
 2106  for datafile in K*.txt; do echo countword $datafile "america"; done
 2107  for datafile in K*.txt; do echo bash ./countword $datafile "america"; done
 2108  for datafile in K*.txt; do bash ./countword $datafile "america"; done
 2109  history |tail -n 5
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> then we can re-run `countword` on our files by typing 
> `!2108`.
{: .callout}

> ## Other History Commands

> That's useful more often than you might expect: after
