This Library Carpentry lesson provides an introduction to the Unix Shell.
At the conclusion of the lesson you will: understand the basics of the Unix shell;
understand why and how to use the command line;
use shell commands to work with directories and files;
use loops to run the same tasks on many files;
understand the basics of shell scripts to automate tasks

The material is based on a combination of the [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) and [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) shell lessons, both of which cover more than we have time to cover here. 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Data: Download the file **[shell-lesson.zip](https://github.com/mawds/library-shell/raw/gh-pages/data/shell-lesson.zip)** from GitHub to your *desktop* and extract it there.
> You should now have a folder called "shell-lesson" there.
